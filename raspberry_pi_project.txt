PROJECT: Weather Report System and Digital Clock
	Goal ==> Create a Weather Report System and Digital Clock with a GUI 


GENERAL IDEAS AND OUTLINE
	> have GUI run on startup so that's the only thing that the user sees
		. Tkinter
		. guizero
	
	> have it compare real / local weather being reported to the info collected
		. PyOWM [Python OpenWeatherMap]
		. python-weather

	> little image to correspond with weather [sunny - sun, cloudy - cloud, raining - raincloud]
	> coding will probably be in Python


	For Weather Report System ==> DHT11 Sensor
		+ Temperature Sensor
		+ Humidity Sensor

	For Digital Clock ==> TM1637 4 digit display
		+ Outputs 4 Digits onto Display

TO-DO
	< divide up work
	< circuiting and wiring
		. figure out needed hardware from Reyes [can just use mine i guess]
	< code basic input / output of modules
	< code GUI to present collected data
	< write presentation



DONE
	1. set up raspberry pi (VNC, SSH, FTP)
	2. download DHT library ("sudo pip3 install Adafruit_DHT" in  terminal)
